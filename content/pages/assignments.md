Mid-term Exam
-------------

There will be an open-note, sit-down, one hour in-class midterm exam during Week 6. The exam will cover the material from the first six weeks of the course.

Final Exam
----------

The final exam is an open-note, sit-down exam after the last class. Study questions will be distributed before the final exam. These questions will be closely related but not identical to those asked on the actual exam.

Term Paper

Students will write a term paper, consisting of an analysis of a current conventional forces problem.

The paper will be due in stages:

*   a topic due during Week 3
*   a preliminary outline due during Week 5
*   a detailed outline due during Week 8
*   the final paper due during Week 11
